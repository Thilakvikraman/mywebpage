#ChildHood<br/>
      I was born on April 21st 2000 in Pollachi.My parents are Murugavel,a Farmer and Hemalatha ,a house-wife. My family is the biggest strength of mine.Since,I was the only kid of my parents I was given the freedom to choose the path what I wanted.I was the youngest kid of all my cousins,I really had an opportunities to learn from them.I joined school  at the age of 3, in RVS Matriculation Higher Secondary School.<br/>
##School-Life<br/>
      I was one of the silent students in the class.I had very small group of friends during my schoolings.From my schoolings, I am interested in speaking,so I had participated in elocution competitions and won prizes too.In addition to that I was one of the top scoring students in the class. My passion in working with computers started when, I was allowed to paint in the computer for the very first time.<br/>
###College life<br/>
      Soon after my completion of schoolings,I joined in the stream of Computer Science and Engineering at Sri Eshwar College of Engineering . Initially, I was little hesitant about volunteering myself in any of the activities held in the college.Suddenly,one fine evening I started realizing ,"In order to widen my horizons,I should start participating in the events",so I started partipating in MOC for various events held in my college.<br/>
 ####Fun Loving Friends<br/>
      Always,friends are  meant to be pillars in one's life.Though, I had very less number of friends in my school,in contrary to that I have larger friends in my college.My friends are always being my stress busters.My friends gave lot of confident to face the reality.Moreover,as like me my friends are also fun loving persons,We make the surroundings happy.<br/>
